# Personal Website

Follow normal NextJS setup steps, `npm i` then `npm run dev`. All hosting and publishing is automatically taken care of on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

This website is built on NextJS and Tailwind CSS, aiming to be as small and quick as possible. It also sometimes serves to host any blog posts or side projects I have going at the moment.

> Disclaimer: At any time I may decide to rebuild this site in a completely new technology, because who doesn't love new shiny tech. ðŸ™‚
